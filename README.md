# NBA2k20 player database analysis Project with Python

## EDA and Correlation Python Pandas, MatPlotLib and Seaborn project that analyses NBA2k20 player database

In this project I used Python Pandas, MatPlotLib and Seaborn, as well as my analytical skills to Export and Clean the data, Depict and Analyse the correlation of values and Visualise the data. It is initialy a showcase of skills I have as an aspiring data analyst in Python, where I use a themed database that matches my personal interest in sports and gaming. "EDA and Correlation NBA 2k" consists of 4 main parts:

* Pandas Expoting And Cleaning: precise and speicifc preparation process for data used in the project
* Correlation Analysis: using a heatmap and .corr to study correlation between values of the cleaned table with Pearson's correlation coeficient
* MatPoltLib and Seaborn EDA and Visualisations: using cleaned data and information about the correlated measures to plot and see the information from a different point of view
* Project Conclusions: personal conclusions describing the analysis in a form of very short paragraphs for a viewer of a project to understand the findings of each part
